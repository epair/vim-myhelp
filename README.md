# Emmett's Vim Cheatsheet

This is my personal Vim cheatsheet. Inspired by
[Matt Butcher](http://technosophos.com/2014/10/09/create-built-in-vim-cheatsheet.html)
and
[Fong Chu Chan](https://tinyheero.github.io/2017/11/04/vim-cheatsheet.html).

## Installation

The cheatsheet is used as a plugin. For plugin managers like
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), you can add the following to
your `~/.vimrc`.

```
Plug 'epair/vim-myhelp'
```

Install the plugin `:PlugInstall` and then you should be able to type 
`:h myhelp`.
